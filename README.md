Always trying to be more kind, patient, and reasonable with people.

Currently pursuing a CS degree at the University of Toronto.

I'm especially interested in developing computer games and BETTER social media platforms.

Most of my repositories are private for now. They'll be made public when they're ready :-)

My Github avatar was created by [@annahuynhly](https://github.com/annahuynhly). Thanks Anna!
