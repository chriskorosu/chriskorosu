Trying to be kind, patient, and reasonable with people, and to have some fun along the way ðŸ˜‰

Currently pursuing a CS degree at the University of Toronto. 

Always happy to talk about anything!

I'm especially interested in developing computer games and social media platforms.

Most of my repositories are private for now. I will consider making some of them public in the future.
